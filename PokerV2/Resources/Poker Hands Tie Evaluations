how to determine winner of tie hands (same rank)....high cards

FaceScore method returns array of point per card.  look at pattern for non-flush hands

1.  High Card, Straight & Straight Flush
	find index of highest card in array
	reverse loop (start at last element in array and work backwards)
	
2.  Pair, Two Pair
	Find index of highest non-pair card (point value for card == 1)
	reverse loop (start at last element in array and work backwards)
	
3.  Three of a Kind, Four of a Kind, Full House
	Find which hand has the higher collection, index of the collection
	Three of a Kind:  look for index where value == 3
	Four of a kind:  look for index where value == 4
	
4.  Royal Flush
	Tie...no such thing as higher hand
